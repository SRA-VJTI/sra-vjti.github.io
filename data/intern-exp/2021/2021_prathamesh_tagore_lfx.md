# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

This internship was about investigating ways to accelerate multidimensional convolutions on RISC-V architecture with wider vector support on instruction level. The duration was from September 2021 - November 2021.

# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

I applied via the official portal of The Linux Foundation.

# What was your project about ?

The work involved creation of a novel algorithm with custom boundary extrapolation, specifically suited for wider vector architectures such as RISC-V. I also presented my work in the global mentorship summit organized by The Linux Foundation which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H08LzJamo0o).

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

It was a remote internship. The environment was supportive and helpful.

# How much was your stipend ?

3000 USD (paid in two installments)

# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?

# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.

Be thorough with C++, basics of compiler backend, LLVM style lowering. Make sure to present your work properly (with source code and relevant proofs). Make sure to communicate effectively.
