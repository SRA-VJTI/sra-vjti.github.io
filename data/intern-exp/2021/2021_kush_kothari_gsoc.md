# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

Google Summer of Code is an open source program where Google encourages open source development by giving stipends to students who are willing to work on open source projects. Students submit proposals and the organizations select them based on how good the proposal is.

# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

Approached it via the open gitter channel, at https://gitter.im/weecology/retriever

# What was your project about ?

My pr was responsible for adding support for spatial datasets to the retrieverdash project, a Django project aiming to test the availability of the datasets around retriever.

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

While I was working for researchers in the University of Florida, GSoC is remote and doesn't require travelling. Neither was much research involved.

# How much was your stipend ?

$1500 USD, same for every Indian in GSoC '21

# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?

My final [blog](https://kushkothari200-medium.com/gsoc-final-report-6fcade313d9f) is a good place to get started.

# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.

Keep a mentality of open source in mind, and the communication with your mentor is the most important for selection. Wise project selection is also a must.
