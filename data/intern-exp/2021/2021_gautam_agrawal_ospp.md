# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

Open Source Promotion Plan is an international, annual program in which PRC awards stipends to students who successfully complete a free and open source software coding project during the summer. I was working with Project-C, which is an open source project that provides BMQ(Bit Map Queue) and PDS-mq(Priority and Deadline based Skiplist multiple queue) cpu scheduler support.

# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

I mailed the mentor regarding my interest in the project. He asked me to submit a summary on schedulers and my knowledge on linux kernel tree via email. I also registered on the OSPP portal and submitted a proposal regarding the projects, with detailed description of the timeline.

# What was your project about ?

Linux kernel 5.10 LTS is the long term support branch of linux kernel, i.e. support for latest driver and scheduler given in latest kernel version should be back ported to the linux 5.10 so that the industry using the LTS version do not suffer any issues. My project was to backport the scheduler feature from Linux 5.13 and Linux 5.12 to the LTS version. The backport required reviewing commits and understanding the major part of the scheduler. At the end of the project, the last 2 weeks were spent to run the test on the kernel, few reported bugs were solved and the Linux 5.10 LTS patch was released.
