# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

We fixed a problem statement over email about link prediction using Graph Neural Networks.

# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

I mailed Professor Rupesh Nasre as per the instructions on his web page.

# What was your project about ?

The task I was given was to increase the accuracy of Link Prediction of large graph datasets like SNAP, etc. when there is at least one common link (edge between 2 nodes).
Even though I was very enthusiastic, my knowledge lagged far behind the latest literature in graph ML. Within a span of 2 months (lesser than that) it was not possible for me to come up with something that's better than current methods. I did learn a lot about GNNs, etc.

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

I did a remote internship because it was COVID-19.

# How much was your stipend ?

Nothing, interest basis.

# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?

Check out the examples from SNAP and DGL.

# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.

Donâ€™t take suggestions on topics neither of you are familiar with. Also clarify whether they are going to provide you with an LOR before starting anything.
