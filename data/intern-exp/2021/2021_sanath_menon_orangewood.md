Orangewood Labs is a design-led and a Y Combinator backed tech startup based out of San Francisco and Noida founded by Mr Abhinav Das and Mr Akash bansal..Their aim is to build affordable robotic arms for SMEs.I was a Software Intern working on research and development on their industry standard 5 Dof Robotic Arm.We also had to make useful and innovative modifications to the software aspects of the arm for ease of use in Industries.

# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

They had put up various offers on [NextGig](https://thenextgig.net/) and other websites as the company

was increasing its workforce on a large scale.I approached Nextgig and they connected me with the company for the interview and selection process.

# What was your project about ?

We had to work on the Software Aspects of the 5 Dof Robotic Arm.Initially,there was a bit of training to get us up to speed with the project.I worked on Cartesian Trajectory Planning for their arm using ROS ,gazebo and Moveit.Trajectories for performing welding/soldering using the arm were planned.I also worked on creating online interfaces to teleoperate the Arm from any city in the world.Various other interfaces for error detection and reporting were also planned. Research on future upgrades to integrate Robotic Arms With Virtual Reality Using Unity was also carried out.

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

The internship was done from home.Work on the Arm was done via teleoperation.A fun Hackathon to bond with the team members was also organized!
