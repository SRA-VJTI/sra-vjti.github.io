# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on introducing students to open source software development. Students work on a 10 week programming project with an open source organization during their break from a post secondary academic program.

As a part of Google Summer of Code, student participants are paired with a mentor from the participating organizations, gaining exposure to real-world software development and techniques. Students have the opportunity to spend the break between their school semesters earning a stipend while working in areas related to their interests.

In turn, the participating organizations are able to identify and bring in new developers who implement new features and hopefully continue to contribute to open source even after the program is over. Most importantly, more code is created and released for the use and benefit of all.

I was working for FOSSi FOundation to create a block based circuit design solution. The program ran for 10 weeks at the end of which I had to give a detailed description of my activity and a proof of concept demonstration for the tool.

# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

I joined their gitter channel, and interacted with my mentors and other students applying for the project about my interest, doubts and progress in the project. Then one has to sign up with the GSoC portal, and upload the project proposal for the specific project, which would then be reviewed by the organization.

# What was your project about ?

Block-Based Circuit Design is a solution to counter the complexity of Circuit Design. We aim to develop and deploy a Block-Based TL-Verilog solution for developers and new entrants to the sphere. Powered by Blockly from Google, it will deliver a simple, concise, and intuitive gateway to Circuit Design.

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

GSoC is remote, N/A

# How much was your stipend ?

**$1500** in 2 evaluations of 45% (week 6) and 55%(week 10) payment

# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.

Experiment a lot. The mentors are not looking for an execution man, they are looking for your opinions on the project as well. Have a clear vision of how you would like the project completion to look like and communicate that to your peers and mentors.
