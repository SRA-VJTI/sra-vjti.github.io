# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

e-Yantra is a robotics outreach program funded by the Ministry of Education and hosted at IIT Bombay. I was a Summer Intern at the eYantra Lab, IIT Bombay working on a Robotics Project for a period of 6-7 weeks. Projects at eYantra Lab include a variety of domains including Robotics, Control Systems, Embedded Systems, Web Dev, AI/ML, Computer Vision.

# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

Interns are usually selected through either the e-Yantra Robotics Challenge or e-Yantra Innovation Challenge. Performing well in these gives you a chance to interview for the internship in which you are asked about your preferences from the available projects.

# What was your project about ?

Modeling and Control of Two-Legged Wheeled Robot: A two wheeled robot (with a hip and knee joint) which can balance at variable heights including a provision for jumping.

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

The campus experience at IIT Bombay was amazing. The facilities related to our work such as a good working space, required hardware for our project, etc were provided to us. Even the other on-campus facilities were great. Also, we had to team up with people from all over the country which was a great learning experience for all of us.

# How much was your stipend ?

Confidential.

# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?

The project is not currently open sourced. If ever it becomes open sourced that I will put up a link here.

# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.

Put in efforts during the 6 month long eYantra Robotics Competition and perform well :)
Research about the projects in your preference list before the interview, this will help in getting a headstart for the internship as well.
