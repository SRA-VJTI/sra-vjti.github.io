# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

This internship is currently in progress and is about HPC via compiler based optimizations and parallel programming (though not in the traditional OpenMP sense, they want me to use their custom infrastructure to produce workable OpenCL/OpenMP code : I still don’t have a proper hang of it).

# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

I approached the professor and a PhD candidate named Thomas Kœhler via cold-mailing (after reading their research paper related to domain-extensible compilers). My interview experience and introduction mail are uploaded on #interview-experience channel of SRA Discord server.

# What was your project about ?

The work is not complete yet. As of now, I am spending time to become more familiar with their custom infrastructure for domain-extensible compilers.

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

GSoC is remote.

# How much was your stipend ?

Confidential.

# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?

Nope, the project is still in its cradle.

# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.

Be thorough with C++, basics of compiler backend, LLVM style lowering. Prior research experience helps a lot. Make sure to present your work properly (with source code and relevant proofs). Make sure to communicate effectively.

# What is the best way to contact you ?
