# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

This internship was about implementation of the Digital Audio Processing Dialect (DAP) using MLIR to improvise the performance of the audio processing filters such as Biquad and IIR filters. The duration was from July 2022 - September 2022. 

# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

I applied via the official portal of the Open Source Promotion Plan(OSPP).

# What was your project about ?

The buddy compiler is a domain-specific compiler infrastructure which includes a separate dedicated dialect for performing audio/speech processing operations using MLIR. This dialect is termed as DAP (digital audio processing) dialect. The project intends to add support for Biquad and IIR operation in DAP dialect. Developed operations were supported with tests and benchmarks for comparing and benchmarking the obtained output against existing state of the art implementation(s) in audio/speech processing. Based on the operations, this project also provides the C/C++ interface and corresponding examples.
Using the vector dialect of MLIR, a vectorized version of the standard Biquad and IIR audio filter algorithms is developed. As compared to the present state-of-the-art implementation, up to a 40x performance increase was achieved.

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

It was a remote internship. The environment was supportive and helpful. 

# How much was your stipend ?

12000 RMB(Yuan)

# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.

Be thorough with C++, basics of compiler backend, LLVM style lowering. Make sure to present your work properly (with source code and relevant proofs). Make sure to communicate effectively.
