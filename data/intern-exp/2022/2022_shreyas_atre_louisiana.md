# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

We improvise every Tuesday what needs to be done. Pretty much continuation of my GSoC 2022 work. Except a bit more research oriented and self driven.

# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

They approached me and why would I say no.

# What was your project about ?

I am yet to complete it. But I plan to focus on getting papers out of it.

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

The organization is STE||AR Group at Louisiana State University. An uplifting and chill environment.

# How much was your stipend ?

USD 1000+ per month depending on how it goes.

# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?

Check [this](https://gist.github.com/SAtacker/38e8fc1c386fab3566f9e008bcf727e0) final report.

# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.

Be thorough with C++. (Please don’t consider yourself a C++ programmer if all you do is use external library APIs and don’t know template metaprogramming)

# What is the best way to contact you ?
