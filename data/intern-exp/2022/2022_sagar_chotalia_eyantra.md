# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

eYantra is a robotics outreach programme held by eYantra Labs at IIT Bombay, and funded by the Govt. of India. They hold competitions like eYRC and eYIC each year, to familiarise students with concepts of robotics and entrepreneurship.

# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

eYantra recruits interns as the Winners/Finalists/noteworthy participants of eYRC and eYIC competitions. They usually don't accept walk-ins or cold mails.

# What was your project about ?

I had to develop an autonomous nano drone stack, and perform indoor localisation on it. The stack was intended to be readily shipped out to students so that they wouldn't have to go through the hassle of finding parts themselves.

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

The internship was in-person, so we got to experience the amazing campus at IIT-B. The work hours were officially 10am-6pm, but it was actually quite chill. The mentors just had a set of deliverables per 2-3 days, and as long as they were met, we could come and leave as we liked.

# How much was your stipend ?

Confidential.

# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?

The project is not currently open sourced. If ever it becomes open sourced that I will put up a link here.

# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.

Perform well in eYRC/eYIC, atleast such that they notice you.
