# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

Participated in Google Summer of Code 2022 as a student. The project was to implement a coroutine interface for the P2300 facilities provided by HPX.

# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

Approach the mentors on IRC. Question about the project in a smart way.

# What was your project about ?

My project is about the Senders and Receivers Proposal P2300 of the ISO C++ Community which is about to be accepted into C++26. It is a generalized programming model for synchronous and asynchronous programming. It takes into consideration both - concurrency and parallelism. Some of the facilities proposed in this paper are already implemented in HPX. However a major part of it was remaining which is the coroutine integration. This project aimed at completing the coroutine support for the HPX S/R.

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

The organization is STE||AR Group at Louisiana State University. An uplifting and chill environment.

# How much was your stipend ?

$3000 in 2 evaluations of 45% (week 6) and 55% (week 12) payment

# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?

Check [this](https://gist.github.com/SAtacker/38e8fc1c386fab3566f9e008bcf727e0) final report.

# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.

Be thorough with C++. (Please don’t consider yourself a C++ programmer if all you do is use external library APIs and don’t know template metaprogramming)
