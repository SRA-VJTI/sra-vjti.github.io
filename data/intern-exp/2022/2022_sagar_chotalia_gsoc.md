# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors. My project was under the sub-org RADIS, which comes under the umbrella org OpenAstronomy.

# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

Selections are mainly done on the basis of contributions to the org’s GitHub repository, solving issues and then submitting a proposal to work on a project of your choice. My proposal was reviewed by the sub-org maintainer atleast 5-6 times before he said it was good enough.

# What was your project about ?

My project was about improving and tweaking the performance of the RADIS codebase. Initially, my project also involved showing a Proof-of-Concept for moving dataset handling from the Pandas library to a library better suited for huge datasets, such as Vaex or Dask. However, this plan was scrapped after a discussion with my maintainer, who informed me that it would take me more than the time limit of my project.

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

GSoC was online. My organisation and the mentors were excellent. The main mentor assigned to me never really talked to me during my project duration, so I got to interact with the maintainer of the RADIS repo throughout my internship. He was really kind and understanding, even allowing for timeline restructuring because I was working on another internship at the time.

# How much was your stipend ?

$1500 in 2 evaluations of 45% (week 6) and 55% (week 12) payment

# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?

Here’s the link to my GSoC [Blog](https://sagarchotalia.github.io/Blog/) and the RADIS [repository](https://github.com/radis/radis).

# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.

Start GSoC preparation early. Decide on an organisation after joining the Slack/IRC channels, be active on them and start solving good first issues by February itself. This will give you a huge advantage when the time comes for your proposal to be ranked.
