# Introduction of Speaker ?

Gautam Agrawal is a final-year IT student at VJTI, Mumbai. He has been working with Embedded Systems right from his first year and is experienced in programming with C/C++ and Rust. He was a Google Summer of Code intern with QEMU and interned in the Open Source Promotion Plan under Project C. Currently he is doing GSOC under QEMU. He delivered a talk on Real Time Operating Systems(RTOS) to other SRA members and juniors taking part in Eklavya.  


# Gist of the talk?

The talk introduced the attendees to Real TIme Operating Systems (RTOS). It started with Gautam explaining why RTOS were needed and where they were used. Then we went into the basics of an RTOS what they are, how they work and a brief about FreeRTOS. Then the attendees were introduced to the concept of Scheduling and various scheduling algorithms. Scheduling was followed by Context Switching and Memory in RTOS. We talked about the Stack and what functions are used to allocate memory in FreeRTOS. Next was the exciting part where the attendees were given a demo of an example program on FreeRTOS and taught how to write one themselves. Once the attendees had an idea about how to make a program, they were introduced to Tasks and Inter-Task Communication in FreeRTOS. The session ended with an interactive Q&A session. The attendees were then given further resources to explore by themselves.
