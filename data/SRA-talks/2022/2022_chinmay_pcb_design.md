# Introduction of Speaker ?

Chinmay Lonkar is a third-year student pursuing B.Tech in Electrical Engineering at VJTI, Mumbai. He has been working with Embedded Systems, PCB Designing from his school days and is experienced in programming with C/C++. He worked as a Hardware Design intern at UpSide Down Labs during his summer break after second semester. He delivered a talk on PCB Designing to other SRA members and juniors taking part in Eklavya.

# Gist of the talk ?

The talk introduced the attendees to PCB Designing. It started with Chinmay explaining why there is a need for PCBs and how they are better than traditional methods, then we went to basics of PCB Designing from creating schematic to exporting final gerber files for fabrication of PCB. The attendees designed their first PCB during the session, they learned how to import various required components in the schematic, making the required circuit, use of footprints for the components after that we moved on to aligning all the components in Pcbnew, followed by routing. They were then introduced to all the important steps that you should follow while designing the PCB from sourcing the components from various sites to maintaining the Bill Of Material(BOM). The session ended with an interactive Q&A session. The attendees were then given further resources to explore by themselves and an assignment to get them hands on practice.
