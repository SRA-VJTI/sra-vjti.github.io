## Introduction of the Speaker

Abhinav Venkatadri graduated from VJTI, Mumbai. He has expertise in the field of computer vision and deep learning. He participated in Google Summer of Code at the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF), where he developed an eye tracker in Python and improved and updated the state of the art tracker. He gave a presentation to other SRA members about his most recent research paper and shared his experiences from developing the idea for the paper to publishing it.

## Gist of the talk

The talk addressed the attendees to the research being done to supplement machine learning with image processing methods to make plant pathology more accessible to study. He began by discussing literature and the uniqueness of his approach, where he was able to achieve greater accuracy using Machine Learning methods compared to most existing methods that used Neural Networks, while also using fewer computational resources. He discussed creating custom datasets and combining them with other popular datasets for better robustness. The pre-processing step was then described, along with each filter's purpose and how it was applied. Later, he utilised this to extract 17 features from the image based on its colour, texture, and shape.

He also discussed the use of various colour models in disease detection. Later, he displayed the results and outcomes and the efficiency of this. He then came to a conclusion by outlining the future direction and work in this subject. This was followed by a much interactive and insighiful Q&A session, the session continued along as the speaker presented his entire path as well as advice for publishing a research paper.
