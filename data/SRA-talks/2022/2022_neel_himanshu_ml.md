# Introduction of Speakers ?

Neel Shah is an undergraduate student at VJTI pursuing Computer engineering. He has been working with AI/ML right from his first year and is experienced in python and creating ML Models.In his second year he won 1st prize in Vision beyond Limits (VBL) competition conducted by IIT Bombay,Techfest which was based on multi-class classification approach for disaster assessment from the given dataset of post-earthquake satellite imagery. He was a Google Summer of Code intern at CERN HSF.

Himanshu Chougule is an undergraduate student at VJTI pursuing B.Tech in Information Technology. He has experience with ML/RL and its allied domains. He has been working with Reinforcement Learning right from his First Year and is experienced in python and creating RL Models. He is a Google Summer of Code Intern At Orthogonal Research And Education Lab under the INCF Organization.

Himanshu And Neel delivered a talk regarding Learning methods(ML,DL,RL) and their applications in Robotics, during one of the domain sessions at Society of Robotics and Automation (SRA), VJTI.

# Gist of the talk?

The talk introduced the attendees to the vast domain of Artificial Intelligence. It started with Neel explaining the basics of Linear Algebra, and its importance in further topics. Then we introduced the broad topics of Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep learning, explaining what they are, how they work and the differences among them. This session covered the basics of each domain by covering its important topics and their needs. Neel also showed a demo of his work in GSoC under CERN and how the exposure to this domain helped him in his internship. This was followed by Himanshu who explained Reinforcement learning by giving intuitive examples to the attendees. He explained the need for RL, how it is different from other Learning methods by giving emphasis on learning through interaction with its environment. He also explained where learning methods can be used and their importance in robotics. The session ended with an interactive Q&A session. The attendees were then given further resources to explore by themselves.
