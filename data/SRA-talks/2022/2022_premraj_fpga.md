# Introduction of Speakers ?

Premraj Jadhav is an undergraduate student at VJTI pursuing Electronics Engineering. He has experience with RISC-V, FPGAs, Digital Design and what not. He delivered a talk regarding Introduction to Verilog and FPGAs during one of the domain sessions at Society of Robotics and Automation (SRA), VJTI.

Om Sheladia is an undergraduate student at VJTI pursuing B.Tech in Information Technology. He has experience with Embedded Systems, FPGAs, Digital Design, PCB Design. He delivered a talk regarding FPGAs and the Finite State Machines (FSM) during one of the domain sessions at Society of Robotics and Automation (SRA), VJTI.

Siddesh started working with Computer architecture in his initial graduation years, designing a 32 bit CPU core in Logisim. Then taking up FPGAs, he worked with the Soil Monitoring Bot in eYRC, hardware security (PUF) for FPGAs, and explored functional approach for hardware design as an intern at IITB.

# Gist of the talk?

This talk was a part of the Domain Awareness Program, which dealt with the domain of FPGAs. The session was very interactive as the mentees were instructed to code along and they found it interesting. The session started with FPGAs, itâ€™s internal working, its architecture then moved on with basics of Verilog and ended with Finite State Machine with a live example of color changing RGB LED mounted on a FPGA as an example of the transition between different states.
