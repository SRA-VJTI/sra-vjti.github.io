# Introduction of Speaker ?

Anushree Sabnis is a mechanical student in her final year at VJTI in Mumbai. She has been working in the robotics field since her first year. She has completed a number of internships. She worked as an embedded development intern for Munga Innovation Private Limited, a summer intern for AIRPIX, a summer intern for Magnes, and so on. She has also made significant contributions to open source organisations. She interned at Open Robotics as part of the Open Source Promotion Plan (OSPP) and at Open Horizon as part of the Linux Foundation's Mentorship Program. She also did research internships at the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems (IISC) and EPFL (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne).

# Gist of the talk?

Anushree gave a fantastic presentation on her work at the BioRobotics Laboratory, where she studied the human gait, or the cyclical motion we make when walking; she researched the muscle groups used during walking, their mathematical models, and how to simulate the same using various packages, optimizing energies for efficient walking.
Anushree created a controller for human gait that uses PD control for spinal stability and sends constant signals to muscle groups with a specific constant range of motion.
She described the various studies and benchmarks carried out, as well as how her work incorporated and built on previous work. She also created a number of graphs to demonstrate her final results.
