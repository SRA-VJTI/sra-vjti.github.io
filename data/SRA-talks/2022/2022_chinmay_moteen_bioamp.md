# Introduction of Speakers ?

Chinmay Lonkar is a third-year student pursuing B.Tech in Electrical Engineering at VJTI, Mumbai. He has been working with Embedded Systems, PCB Designing and robotics from his school days and is experienced in programming with C/C++. He worked as a Hardware Design intern at UpSide Down Labs during his summer break after second semester. He is also an upcoming Field Analog Apllication Intern at Texas Instruments.

Moteen Shah is a third-year student pursuing B.Tech in EXTC at VJTI, Mumbai. He has been working with embedded systems, bootloaders and robotics right from his junior year and is experienced in programming with C/C++, python embedded firmware development. He worked as a Hardware Design intern at UpsideDown Labs during his summer break after second semister. He was also selected as a mentee under Open Source Promotion Plan(OSPP) under the org AOSC.

They delivered a talk on the work done as the interns at UDL in which they developed a C++ library for Bio-Potential Signal filtering.

# Gist of the talk?

The talk introduced the atendees a small yet powerful sensor, the BioAmp EXG Pill. It's a small (2.54 X 1.00 cm) and elegant Analog Front End (AFE) board for BioPotential signal acquisition that you can use with any 5v Micro Controller Unit (MCU) with an ADC. It is capable of recording publication grade BioPotential signals like ECG, EMG, EOG, and EEG without the inclusion of any dedicated Hardware/Software filter. Chinmay and Moteen explained how the electric bio-potential signals were aquired from the human body using various techniques like Electromyography. Atendees also got to know how digital bandpass filters can be used to filter out analog signals from the sensor.
