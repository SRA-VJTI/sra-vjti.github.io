# Introduction of Speaker ?

Saurabh Nair is currently a **Deep Learning Research Engineer at [Giant.AI](http://giant.ai/)** in California. He has completed his **Masters in Robotics Systems Development from Carnegie Mellon University**, and completed his B.Tech. in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering from VJTI.

Saurabh has held an illustrious record ever since his undergraduate days, working as a research intern at the COE-CNDS and completing various other internships in Robotics and Software development, and has published research papers in high-level conferences such as IEEE.

# Gist of the talk?

Saurabh delivered an excellent talk on [**Neural Radiance Fields(NeRF(s))**](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf), a cutting-edge topic involving something known as **Inverse Graphics**. The NeRF algorithm whose input is a single continuous 5D coordinate (spatial location (x, y, z) and viewing direction (θ, φ)) and whose output is the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location. This enables viewing of 2D images in a 3D environment.

Saurabh started by explaining some of the basics of Computer Graphics, Reflection, Lambertian Surfaces moving on to explaining Inverse Graphics followed by how NeRF achieves the same.

He went into the depths of the concepts of Rendering a Scene and Ray Tracing volume densities to the training model of NeRF.

Along with all the rich, brain-teasing content, he also explained the different types of NERFs and their importance in other domains such as Robotics.
