# Introduction of Speaker ?

Omkar Bhilare is a graduated Electronics student(Batch 2022) at VJTI, Mumbai. He had been working with Embedded Systems,FPGA and hardware related stuff right from his first year and is experienced in programming with C/C++. He was a Google Summer of Code intern with Beagleboard.Org in 2021 and had also interned at the Shakti Labs,IIT Madras. He had traveled to Switzerland to attend the EPFL 2022 programme. He spoke to other SRA members and juniors participating in Eklavya in 2021 about his experience with GSOC 2021 with Beagleboard.Org.

# Gist of the talk?

The talk's introduction began with GSoC: what was it? What were the requirements or tech stack you needed to submit an application for a project with an organization? Following the project's introduction, the attendees had a quick look at the project's proposal. He described the responsibilities and requirements he had to meet in order to become familiar with BeagleBoard and its community. Then, he outlined the requirements for his project and how he built and tested a Gateware for Beaglewire (Lattice iCE40 FPGA-cape) for Beaglebone Black before going on to his job weekwise. It was interesting to learn how he approached each error step by step and how they caught him for days and nights to solve.
The session quickly skimmed over the VGA Driver Design for Beaglewire that he had tested in hardware using VGA PMOD. Additionally, he had developed gateware for the PONG game and an encoder PMOD for Beaglewire.
An engaging Q&A session followed the presentation. The participants were subsequently provided other materials to research on their own.
