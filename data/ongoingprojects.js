        PSP Bot : Pick Sort and Place Bot is customly designed, 3 Axis XYZ
        Gantry based Pick and Place Robotic Solution for Industry Packaging
        lines housing variable sized input items or boxes. It uses and efficient
        item sorting and packaging algorithm to pick and place input items from
        an incoming conveyor into an output container ensuring minimum space
        wastage. Its primary use is in the Multinational Packaging supply chain
        industry for variable sized item packaging and location based packaging.

        Smart Multi-Object Realtime Tracking (SMORT) aims to study major types
        of object tracking algorithms and finally build a robust object tracker
        which can overcome some critical problems like occlusion, light
        Intensity difference, re-identification etc.
        <br />
        This is a research oriented project in which a pre-existing algorithm is
        studied in great detail from its official research record and a custom
        implementation is created from it. This helps us understand some
        intrinsic details of the algorithm which prove useful while creating our
        original custom tracker. Implementation of object tracking research
        papers.

        TitanLegs is a customly designed, small, mobile and economical quadruped
        robot specially for dynamic locomotion. It houses and is built on a
        powerful, efficient yet cost effective 3D printed BLDC(Brushless DC)
        Motor based Actuator.
        <br />
        Minimising power wastage, producing robust robotic locomotion and good
        mobility are some of the achieved objectives. Our team has taken the
        approach of designing from scratch most of the components, including a
        cycloidal gearbox, PCB design; so as to get the most out of low-cost
        components.

        MobMan project aims to build a model of a mobile manipulator capable of
        performing various dexterous tasks autonomously. The project is divided
        into two main components:
        <br />
        1. Manipulator Arm: Perform pick and place operations using object
        detection
        <br />
        2. Mobile Base: Perform SLAM for navigation.
