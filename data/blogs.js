              'In the first 3 months, we were divided into groups to tackle different problems. I was part of the group - Traffic violation. The task was to develop an application for vehicle counting, detecting violations like wrong side, red light, speed, helmet and triple seat.We started with listing out the requirements of the product, its users, use cases, deployment requirements and reviewed the technologies available in the market. There used to be meetings at least 2-3 days a week with the mentor. After listing the requirements the task was to get familiar with the object detection networks like yolo, ssd, etc. In the first two weeks I studied about the yolo network (running the pre-trained network and training it for custom classes like helmet). The next task was to track the object and count them. I studied different trackers available like OpenCV inbuilt trackers, SORT, Deep-SORT, etc. After analyzing the runtime, memory and other aspects we decided to use a particular tracker and started with the counting part. Several techniques were tried for the counting part to handle different edge cases. Till this point the team got familiar with the tech and the requirements. We divided the task among ourselves and started working on the application. At the end of 3 months, we were ready with the desktop application providing an interface to add recording, count vehicles based on classes, and detect all the violations.I got an offer to continue the work after this.The work started after my mid-sem exams. The initial task was to develop an application for face recognition. The starter code was already written by the previous interns. The whole project can be summarized as follows: requirement specification → robust detector → network for recognition → storing info in database → testing on large database → visualizing the results on the video frame itself in real time → basic web platform.The next project was to develop an application for license plate recognition (since this will be required after violation detection too). The starter code was available, which was written by the previous interns. The whole project can be summarized as follows: requirement specification → understanding interns’ code → listing out shortcomings → reviewing available methods → trying different techniques → developing pipeline to take in the video and show the license plate text on the frames.The next project was to combine the work of violation team and vehicle classification and develop a desktop application wherein the client can:Add video recordings,Select the tasks to perform,Draw region of interests,Get visual output of all the violations / any event according to the tasks selected.Have the ability to do RUD operations on the output.** All above projects were also made to run on edge platformsThe most important thing to take away from this is that every project should start with the requirement specification and system design. The mentor (Aniket Tatipamula) helped a lot whenever we had no clue of how to develop something at scale. He always urged us to develop the system flow, possible flaws, and their remedies. This helped a lot in understanding the problem and developing the solution for the same.',

I had been approached by the organization to continue the work which we had left previously. I started working with them after the end semester exams were over. The task given to me was to package our application and create a docker container for it.The advantage of docker container were that all your application and dependencies could be packaged as whole, such that the next time you want to deploy your application to the host computer, all you needed to do was to just install the docker container from the repository and execute it, nothing else was needed to install. I was also tasked with on how could we spawn multiple docker containers at a time, and also check if the minimum resources were available  before starting a new container. My other task were to optimize the object detection model such as yolov3 and ssd-mobilenet with Nvidia TensorRt sdk so that it could work with a higher fps on their edge boards,Jetson Nano and Jetson AGX. Wrote a small code which checked for system configuration, based on that used to install the docker container. Also used to sort out any issue which occurred on the AGX board.',

Also the detected vehicles have to be tracked and counted. Further the Indian trucks had to be sub-classified according to the number of axles.For this task our team was given a week to do literature review and get familiar with training and using YOLO, SSD models. Firstly a dataset of Indian vehicles was made and a YOLO model was trained. After training the task was to get inference and check the accuracy of the model. The next task was to track the vehicles to count them. Different trackers like KCF, CSRT, median flow etc were explored and later we used SORT tracker for tracking. For sub-classifying trucks a lightweight model was trained.The second task was to detect speed violations in a video. A report had to be generated and statistics had to be shown. This was a requirement by a client so specific analytics had to be calculated which cannot be disclosed.Weekly meetings took place and during that time the mentor discussed the work done during the week and pointed us towards the right direction whenever we were struck.After this my internship was extended and I was working during the semester. The task was to create a product so that the client can detect specific violations in a rtsp stream/ a video file. It was basically a culmination of the tasks that were done by the vehicle classification and the violation detection team. This product was to be deployed on an edge device. Also, the product had to be made such that it can run on all devices irrespective of the configuration.',

After the custom detection part that main job revolved around detecting suspicious activities which was done using pose detectors along with LSTM to get accurate results.The second half of the internship dealt with working on the traffic monitoring framework which was developed earlier by a team. This module was to be integrated along with the web app as well, so for this the earlier code was to be cleaned and separated into different modules and later multiprocessing was implemented to run different analytics separately. After this, a major task revolved around deploying this application on Nvidia edge (jetson) devices and obtaining optimised and efficient results with better performance.

Regular calibration of these instruments are of utmost importance to maintain the national standard. But the process is time consuming if done manually.

              'Initially, there wasn’t any particular problem statement on which I was working. Being from an engineering background there were a lot of prerequisites to be understood. Under the professor’s guidance, I learned about general relativity followed by its application in the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) Models in cosmology. I then investigated the early universe cosmology and the various theories proposed regarding the same. I got to know about the horizon problem and the flatness problem and how inflationary cosmology solves it. While learning inflationary cosmology I also understood how cosmological fluctuation brings a structure to the universe by understanding Cosmological Perturbation Theory. During this brief period, I was able to develop my mathematical skills in tensor algebra, tensor calculus, differential calculus and also gained contemporary knowledge in the field of cosmology. After gaining the required knowledge I decided my primary research area to be  ‘The Cosmological Constant Problem’. I tried to implement ‘Time Crystals’ as a scalar field for inflationary cosmology which leads to an arbitrarily small positive effective Cosmological Constant.',

Besides these, every iiser and a few iits have their own summer internship programs available at their websites.In my case, I was a bit late to apply to most of these and to get an opportunity to work on the purely theoretical side of physics is a bit difficult for engineering students. So, I started emailing a lot of professors to ask for their guidance and if possible to work under them as a research intern. I tried to contact around 60-70 professors, half of which did not reply and from the other half I got a negative response. After a month-long effort I received a positive response from Patrick sir.  So my suggestion is to keep applying for programs, official or not, as much as you can.',
