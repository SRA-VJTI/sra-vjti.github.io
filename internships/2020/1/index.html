The tasks were related to developing applications for Traffic monitoring, Face recognition, Pose estimation, etc. The position required knowledge in Python, Numpy, OpenCV, Deep Learning frameworks like Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, etc. It started with a 3 months unpaid internship. After that I was given the opportunity to continue the work with a paid internship. I worked under the guidance of Aniket Tatipamula.<br/><br/></p><h1 style="font-family:Oswald;font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:light;padding-bottom:0px;color:#892cdc;line-height:1.5" id="how-do-you-approach-the-organizationuniversity-">How do you approach the Organization/University ?<br/><br/></h1><p style="line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:10px">The application form was sent by my college. But you can also reach out to them via email or linkedin.<br/><br/></p><h1 style="font-family:Oswald;font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:light;padding-bottom:0px;color:#892cdc;line-height:1.5" id="what-was-your-project-about-">What was your project about ?<br/><br/></h1><p style="line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:10px">In the first 3 months, we were divided into groups to tackle different problems. I was part of the group - Traffic violation. The task was to develop an application for vehicle counting, detecting violations like wrong side, red light, speed, helmet and triple seat.<br/><br/></p><p style="line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:10px">We started with listing out the requirements of the product, its users, use cases, deployment requirements and reviewed the technologies available in the market. There used to be meetings at least 2-3 days a week with the mentor. After listing the requirements the task was to get familiar with the object detection networks like yolo, ssd, etc. In the first two weeks I studied about the yolo network (running the pre-trained network and training it for custom classes like helmet). The next task was to track the object and count them. I studied different trackers available like OpenCV inbuilt trackers, SORT, Deep-SORT, etc. After analyzing the runtime, memory and other aspects we decided to use a particular tracker and started with the counting part. Several techniques were tried for the counting part to handle different edge cases. Till this point the team got familiar with the tech and the requirements. We divided the task among ourselves and started working on the application. At the end of 3 months, we were ready with the desktop application providing an interface to add recording, count vehicles based on classes, and detect all the violations.<br/><br/></p><p style="line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:10px">I got an offer to continue the work after this.The work started after my mid-sem exams. The initial task was to develop an application for face recognition. The starter code was already written by the previous interns. The whole project can be summarized as follows: requirement specification → robust detector → network for recognition → storing info in database → testing on large database → visualizing the results on the video frame itself in real time → basic web platform.<br/><br/></p><p style="line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:10px">The next project was to develop an application for license plate recognition (since this will be required after violation detection too). The starter code was available, which was written by the previous interns. The whole project can be summarized as follows: requirement specification → understanding interns&#x27; code → listing out shortcomings → reviewing available methods → trying different techniques → developing pipeline to take in the video and show the license plate text on the frames.<br/><br/></p><p style="line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:10px">The next project was to combine the work of violation team and vehicle classification and develop a desktop application wherein the client can:<br/><br/></p><ul><li>Add video recordings</li><li>Select the tasks to perform</li><li>Draw region of interests</li><li>Get visual output of all the violations / any event according to the tasks selected</li><li>Have the ability to do RUD operations on the output.</li></ul><p style="line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:10px">** All above projects were also made to run on edge platforms<br/><br/></p><p style="line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:10px">The most important thing to take away from this is that every project should start with the requirement specification and system design. The mentor (Aniket Tatipamula) helped a lot whenever we had no clue of how to develop something at scale. He always urged us to develop the system flow, possible flaws, and their remedies. This helped a lot in understanding the problem and developing the solution for the same.<br/><br/></p><h1 style="font-family:Oswald;font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:light;padding-bottom:0px;color:#892cdc;line-height:1.5" id="how-was-the-host-in-terms-of-research-and-campus-life-">How was the host in terms of research and campus life ?<br/><br/></h1><p style="line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:10px">It was remote, N/A<br/><br/></p><h1 style="font-family:Oswald;font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:light;padding-bottom:0px;color:#892cdc;line-height:1.5" id="how-much-was-your-stipend-">How much was your stipend ?<br/><br/></h1><p style="line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:10px">Confidential<br/><br/></p><h1 style="font-family:Oswald;font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:light;padding-bottom:0px;color:#892cdc;line-height:1.5" id="can-you-provide-any-resources-to-check-out-your-project-">Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?<br/><br/></h1><p style="line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:10px">Confidential<br/><br/></p><h1 style="font-family:Oswald;font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:light;padding-bottom:0px;color:#892cdc;line-height:1.5" id="suggestions-to-the-fellow-vjtiians-who-want-to-go-for-this-internship">Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.<br/><br/></h1><p style="line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:10px">Even if you don&#x27;t have specialized knowledge in the topics, the internship gives you the opportunity to excel in those fields and develop industry ready products.

counting, detecting violations like wrong side, red light, speed, helmet and triple seat.","content":"# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?\n\n[Airpix](https://airpix.in/) is a drone / unmanned aerial systems startup based in Navi Mumbai, India. [Airpix.io](https://airpix.io/) is an analytics platform that provides services in face recognition, video analytics, optical character recognition by Leveraging AI, Machine Learning \u0026amp; Deep Learning technologies. [AIsyte](https://aisyte.com/) is the product that provides these analytics services.\n\nMy position in internship was 'AI ML and Edge Computing Intern'. The tasks were related to developing applications for Traffic monitoring, Face recognition, Pose estimation, etc. The position required knowledge in Python, Numpy, OpenCV, Deep Learning frameworks like Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, etc. It started with a 3 months unpaid internship. After that I was given the opportunity to continue the work with a paid internship. I worked under the guidance of Aniket Tatipamula.\n\n# How do you approach the Organization/University ?\n\nThe application form was sent by my college. But you can also reach out to them via email or linkedin.\n\n# What was your project about ?\n\nIn the first 3 months, we were divided into groups to tackle different problems. I was part of the group - Traffic violation. The task was to develop an application for vehicle counting, detecting violations like wrong side, red light, speed, helmet and triple seat.\n\nWe started with listing out the requirements of the product, its users, use cases, deployment requirements and reviewed the technologies available in the market. There used to be meetings at least 2-3 days a week with the mentor. After listing the requirements the task was to get familiar with the object detection networks like yolo, ssd, etc. In the first two weeks I studied about the yolo network (running the pre-trained network and training it for custom classes like helmet). The next task was to track the object and count them. I studied different trackers available like OpenCV inbuilt trackers, SORT, Deep-SORT, etc. After analyzing the runtime, memory and other aspects we decided to use a particular tracker and started with the counting part. Several techniques were tried for the counting part to handle different edge cases. Till this point the team got familiar with the tech and the requirements. We divided the task among ourselves and started working on the application. At the end of 3 months, we were ready with the desktop application providing an interface to add recording, count vehicles based on classes, and detect all the violations.\n\nI got an offer to continue the work after this.The work started after my mid-sem exams. The initial task was to develop an application for face recognition. The starter code was already written by the previous interns. The whole project can be summarized as follows: requirement specification → robust detector → network for recognition → storing info in database → testing on large database → visualizing the results on the video frame itself in real time → basic web platform.\n\nThe next project was to develop an application for license plate recognition (since this will be required after violation detection too). The starter code was available, which was written by the previous interns. The whole project can be summarized as follows: requirement specification → understanding interns' code → listing out shortcomings → reviewing available methods → trying different techniques → developing pipeline to take in the video and show the license plate text on the frames.\n\nThe next project was to combine the work of violation team and vehicle classification and develop a desktop application wherein the client can:\n\n- Add video recordings\n- Select the tasks to perform\n- Draw region of interests\n- Get visual output of all the violations / any event according to the tasks selected\n- Have the ability to do RUD operations on the output.\n\n\\*\\* All above projects were also made to run on edge platforms\n\nThe most important thing to take away from this is that every project should start with the requirement specification and system design. The mentor (Aniket Tatipamula) helped a lot whenever we had no clue of how to develop something at scale. He always urged us to develop the system flow, possible flaws, and their remedies. This helped a lot in understanding the problem and developing the solution for the same.\n\n# How was the host in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nIt was remote, N/A\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nConfidential\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nConfidential\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nEven if you don't have specialized knowledge in the topics, the internship gives you the opportunity to excel in those fields and develop industry ready products. The internship is the best way to understand the importance of ML in production and scaling of the same.\n\nThe company also provides job opportunities in areas of drone development and web designing.\n\n# What is the best way to contact you ?\n\nYou can contact me at my email, [saharshjain2000@gmail.com](mailto:saharshjain2000@gmail.com)\n"},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/internships/[year]/[id]","query":{"year":"2020","id":"1"},"buildId":"n8zcWpMsXd_8tAqgmk2XZ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
