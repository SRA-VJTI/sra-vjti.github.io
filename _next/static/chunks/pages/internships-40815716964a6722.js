The main focus of my research was early time cosmology. The research was completely theoretical and the prerequisites included tensor calculus, differential equations and basic knowledge regarding general relativity. It was a two month long winter internship.\n\n# How do you approach the Organization/University ?\n\nIn general, there are summer internships available at such universities but I was late to apply so I started contacting several professors through their email id available at the university website. I got a positive response from Dr. Patrick Das Gupta but he was unavailable in the coming summer, hence it was a winter internship.\n\n# What was your project about ?\n\nInitially, there wasn't any particular problem statement on which I was working. Being from an engineering background there were a lot of prerequisites to be understood. Under the professor's guidance, I learned about general relativity followed by its application in the Friedmann–Lema\xeetre–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) Models in cosmology. I then investigated the early universe cosmology and the various theories proposed regarding the same. I got to know about the horizon problem and the flatness problem and how inflationary cosmology solves it. While learning inflationary cosmology I also understood how cosmological fluctuation brings a structure to the universe by understanding Cosmological Perturbation Theory. During this brief period, I was able to develop my mathematical skills in tensor algebra, tensor calculus, differential calculus and also gained contemporary knowledge in the field of cosmology. After gaining the required knowledge I decided my primary research area to be 'The Cosmological Constant Problem'. I tried to implement 'Time Crystals' as a scalar field for inflationary cosmology which leads to an arbitrarily small positive effective Cosmological Constant.\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nAs it was not an official internship under the university, I had to stay outside the campus and only interacted with the professors twice a week.\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nN.A.\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nN.A.\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nThere are a lot of opportunities available to work as a research intern in physics.

So, I started emailing a lot of professors to ask for their guidance and if possible to work under them as a research intern. I tried to contact around 60-70 professors, half of which didn't reply and from the other half I got a negative response. After a month-long effort I received a positive response from Patrick sir. So my suggestion is to keep applying for programs, official or not, as much as you can.\n\n# What is the best way to contact you ?\n\n[vednarayan29@gmail.com](mailto:vednarayan29@gmail.com)\n"},6744:function(e,t){"use strict";t.Z="# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?\n\nSummer Research fellowship programme is an annual fellowship provided by the three national Science Academies — Indian Academy of Sciences, Bengaluru, Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi and The National Academy of Sciences, India, Prayagraj.

Regular calibration of these instruments are of utmost importance to maintain the national standard. But the process is time consuming if done manually.

[AIsyte](https://aisyte.com/) is the product that provides these analytics services.\n\nMy position in internship was 'AI ML and Edge Computing Intern'. The tasks were related to developing applications for Traffic monitoring, Face recognition, Pose estimation, etc. The position required knowledge in Python, Numpy, OpenCV, Deep Learning frameworks like Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, etc. It started with a 3 months unpaid internship. After that I was given the opportunity to continue the work with a paid internship. I worked under the guidance of Aniket Tatipamula.\n\n# How do you approach the Organization/University ?\n\nThe application form was sent by my college. But you can also reach out to them via email or linkedin.\n\n# What was your project about ?\n\nIn the first 3 months, we were divided into groups to tackle different problems. I was part of the group - Traffic violation. The task was to develop an application for vehicle counting, detecting violations like wrong side, red light, speed, helmet and triple seat.\n\nWe started with listing out the requirements of the product, its users, use cases, deployment requirements and reviewed the technologies available in the market. There used to be meetings at least 2-3 days a week with the mentor. After listing the requirements the task was to get familiar with the object detection networks like yolo, ssd, etc. In the first two weeks I studied about the yolo network (running the pre-trained network and training it for custom classes like helmet). The next task was to track the object and count them. I studied different trackers available like OpenCV inbuilt trackers, SORT, Deep-SORT, etc. After analyzing the runtime, memory and other aspects we decided to use a particular tracker and started with the counting part.

I was also tasked with on how could we spawn multiple docker containers at a time, and also check if the minimum resources were available before starting a new container. My other task were to optimize the object detection model such as yolov3 and ssd-mobilenet with Nvidia's TensorRt sdk so that it could work with a higher fps on their edge boards,Jetson Nano and Jetson AGX. Wrote a small code which checked for system configuration, based on that used to install the docker container. Also used to sort out any issue which occurred on the AGX board.\n\n# How was the host in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nIt was remote, N/A\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nConfidential\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nConfidential\n\n# What is the best way to contact you ?\n\nYou can contact me at my email, rahulsinghrox701@gmail.com\n"},8761:function(e,t){"use strict";t.Z="# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?\n\n[Airpix](https://airpix.in/) is a drone / unmanned aerial systems startup based in Navi Mumbai, India.

I was part of the group - Traffic violation. The task was to develop an application for vehicle counting, detecting violations like wrong side, red light, speed, helmet and triple seat.\n\nWe started with listing out the requirements of the product, its users, use cases, deployment requirements and reviewed the technologies available in the market. There used to be meetings at least 2-3 days a week with the mentor. After listing the requirements the task was to get familiar with the object detection networks like yolo, ssd, etc. In the first two weeks I studied about the yolo network (running the pre-trained network and training it for custom classes like helmet). The next task was to track the object and count them. I studied different trackers available like OpenCV inbuilt trackers, SORT, Deep-SORT, etc. After analyzing the runtime, memory and other aspects we decided to use a particular tracker and started with the counting part. Several techniques were tried for the counting part to handle different edge cases. Till this point the team got familiar with the tech and the requirements. We divided the task among ourselves and started working on the application. At the end of 3 months, we were ready with the desktop application providing an interface to add recording, count vehicles based on classes, and detect all the violations.\n\nI got an offer to continue the work after this.The work started after my mid-sem exams. The initial task was to develop an application for face recognition. The starter code was already written by the previous interns. The whole project can be summarized as follows: requirement specification → robust detector → network for recognition → storing info in database → testing on large database → visualizing the results on the video frame itself in real time → basic web platform.\n\nThe next project was to develop an application for license plate recognition (since this will be required after violation detection too). The starter code was available, which was written by the previous interns. The whole project can be summarized as follows: requirement specification → understanding interns' code → listing out shortcomings → reviewing available methods → trying different techniques → developing pipeline to take in the video and show the license plate text on the frames.\n\nThe next project was to combine the work of violation team and vehicle classification and develop a desktop application wherein the client can:\n\n- Add video recordings\n- Select the tasks to perform\n- Draw region of interests\n- Get visual output of all the violations / any event according to the tasks selected\n- Have the ability to do RUD operations on the output.\n\n\\*\\* All above projects were also made to run on edge platforms\n\nThe most important thing to take away from this is that every project should start with the requirement specification and system design. The mentor (Aniket Tatipamula) helped a lot whenever we had no clue of how to develop something at scale. He always urged us to develop the system flow, possible flaws, and their remedies. This helped a lot in understanding the problem and developing the solution for the same.\n\n# How was the host in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nIt was remote, N/A\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nConfidential\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nConfidential\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nEven if you don't have specialized knowledge in the topics, the internship gives you the opportunity to excel in those fields and develop industry ready products.

After the custom detection part that main job revolved around detecting suspicious activities which was done using pose detectors along with LSTM to get accurate results.\n\nThe second half of the internship dealt with working on the traffic monitoring framework which was developed earlier by a team. This module was to be integrated along with the web app as well, so for this the earlier code was to be cleaned and separated into different modules and later multiprocessing was implemented to run different analytics separately. After this, a major task revolved around deploying this application on Nvidia edge (jetson) devices and obtaining optimised and efficient results with better performance.

The task was to train a model which can detect, classify and localise Indian vehicles. Also the detected vehicles have to be tracked and counted. Further the Indian trucks had to be sub-classified according to the number of axles.\n\nFor this task our team was given a week to do literature review and get familiar with training and using YOLO, SSD models. Firstly a dataset of Indian vehicles was made and a YOLO model was trained. After training the task was to get inference and check the accuracy of the model. The next task was to track the vehicles to count them. Different trackers like KCF, CSRT, median flow etc were explored and later we used SORT tracker for tracking. For sub-classifying trucks a lightweight model was trained.\n\nThe second task was to detect speed violations in a video. A report had to be generated and statistics had to be shown. This was a requirement by a client so specific analytics had to be calculated which cannot be disclosed.\n\nWeekly meetings took place and during that time the mentor discussed the work done during the week and pointed us towards the right direction whenever we were struck.\n\nAfter this my internship was extended and I was working during the semester. The task was to create a product so that the client can detect specific violations in a rtsp stream/ a video file. It was basically a culmination of the tasks that were done by the vehicle classification and the violation detection team. This product was to be deployed on an edge device. Also, the product had to be made such that it can run on all devices irrespective of the configuration.\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nIt was a remote internship due to COVID.\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nConfidential\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nConfidential\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nMost probably you will receive the application form.

It has a real-time unit inside it called the PRU (Programmable Real-time unit). Since, real-time tasks like sending a pulse every 10 ms, is a difficult task for a chip running any OS which schedules task, there is a need for a co-processor which isn't bound by the scheduler and can do task in real time like a microcontroller can (to an extent). PRU is exactly this co-processor. But programming it is a difficult task, due to its low RAM and ROM size and also due to poor support from TI. So, making it easy for programming was of priority. There were earlier attempts to port interpreted languages onto it, but due to only 8Kb ram this was not feasible. I worked on creating a transpiled language called \\*\\*simpPRU. It had a syntax just like python. It was super easy to get started, and didn't need any extensive language of gcc, C and Linux kernel framework. So, earlier loading a firmware onto PRU meant, compiling the firmware, loading it into PRU using remoteproc framework and then starting it. This was a very steep learning curve for a beginner, So, simpPRU does all this for you, so it is as easy as running and compiling a program. Also, I created a TUI based terminal for reading and writing to the PRU using remoteproc.\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nIt was remote, N/A\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nIt was $3000 divided into 3 evaluations.\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nHere's my project report: [https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/6551712266977280/](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/6551712266977280/)\n\nHere's my project repository: [https://github.com/VedantParanjape/simpPRU](https://github.com/VedantParanjape/simpPRU)\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nStart early, join the organization's communication channel from January itself, and start contributing to their projects, take part in meetings and interact with the possible mentors.

They had already tapeout Moushik, RISECREEK, RIMO processors from SCL and intel foundries. These processors were based on the C and E classes of SHAKTI. Shakti is now going to tapeout the new I class. My project was based primarily on FPGA Based verification of SHAKTI processors. For selected Interns the duration usually depends on project complexity and current need of the Lab. I had interned at SHAKTI Lab for 5 months.\n\n# How do you approach the Organization/University ?\n\nYou can apply on the Shakti site: [https://shakti.org.in/jobs.html](https://shakti.org.in/jobs.html). A former verification team member of shakti referred me to the verification team leader. After that, interviews happened. Shakti usually has open positions related to physical design, verification and software.\n\n# What was your project about ?\n\nC-Class is a member of the SHAKTI family of processors. It is an extremely configurable and commercial-grade 5-stage in-order core supporting the standard RV64GCSUN ISA extensions. Verification is a very important process in chip design. Usually, the software RTL simulation tests on host computers take a very large amount of time. My project explores the possibility of FPGA-based verification of SHAKTI processors to reduce verification time. AAPG is a tool that is intended to generate random RISC-V programs to test RISC-V cores. In this project, I ran AAPG tests on an FPGA and compared the spike's golden signature dump with the FPGA signature dump. The project also explores the self checking tests generated by AAPG. Self-checking tests have the advantage of running on FPGA or silicon without much intervention from the host, thereby accelerating the speed verification significantly.\n\nMore Info can be found here: [https://omkarbhilare.tech/pdf/SHAKTI_REPORT.pdf](https://omkarbhilare.tech/pdf/SHAKTI_REPORT.pdf)\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nIt was remote, but usually interns can directly come to SHAKTI Lab and work there itself.\nSHAKTI has good connections with industry and other VLSI research groups like OPENHW.

A study was done to analyze biological changes in the bodies of musicians singing synchronously in an orchestra. To facilitate this study, various sensors for monitoring heart beat, pulse, breathing, ECG, PPG and real time audio data were the input parameters. To study and note changes in successive events, time synchronization amongst these streams was necessary. Also, these streams were visualized and a white paper was written about it.\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nThe internship took place offline in-person at Montreal, Canada. ETS is situated in the heart of downtown Montreal. Accommodation near downtown is easily findable but could be a bit costly. The University being in the state of Quebec, has French as its primary language and English as its secondary. ETS has the motto - “Engineering for Industry” and hence has a lot of conferences and industry exposure. The campus is accessible throughout with RFID access cards at any time of the day or night, no restrictions. ETS campus is big and has about 5 buildings. My host lab was CRITIAS led by Prof. Dr. J\xe9r\xe9mie Voix funded by NSERC-EERS Canadian-Industrial research chair. The lab research majorly focusses on audio & signal processing, acoustics, in-ear wearable and embedded technologies. The lab officially functions from Monday - Friday 9 to 5 pm. However, the timings and work are flexible. Dynamic research, new methodologies, and trial-tests are highly encouraged. Being a part of the research team gave me access to multiple resources, weekly conference calls, university events and industry networking meets. I also got to learn a lot from the MS and Phd students working at my lab.\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nThe total compensation included shares for flight tickets, visa, accommodation, food and institute fees which was about 8000 CAD.

Start by looking for labs under top universities aligning with your research interests. Go through university specializations. Look at their past interns, projects and publications. You can connect with them over LinkedIn, Mail, etc.\n\nThere is no letter of motivation for this internship. Your selling point is your application and resume. The more research experience you have, the better. I would suggest people to do at least some internship after 2nd year instead of wasting their summer. Also it is possible to work within semesters so try to explore the things that you like by doing a project/ internship etc. as college is not going to teach you anything good. Moreover, getting a Mitacs GRI also enables you for the Mitacs Accelerate Fellowship for doing a masters/ Phd in Canada.\n\n# What is the best way to contact you ?\n\nYou can contact me at my email, dhairyashah110501@gmail.com.

He was really kind and understanding, even allowing for timeline restructuring because I was working on another internship at the time.\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\n$1500 in 2 evaluations of 45% (week 6) and 55% (week 12) payment\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nHere’s the link to my GSoC [Blog](https://sagarchotalia.github.io/Blog/) and the RADIS [repository](https://github.com/radis/radis).\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nStart GSoC preparation early.

The use of technology to address issues of the real world through various themes is their primary objective. My project was to "Explore Functional Approach for Hardware Design," and the internship lasted for around 7 weeks throughout the summer. The lab is engaged in various such interesting projects and researches.\n\n# How do you approach the Organization/University ?\n\nThis opportunity can be approached by participating in the eYantra Robotics Competition(eYRC). It is a 6-month competition featuring several projects to participate from a range of domains. These domains frequently focus on the progress of mankind. After a series of interviews, opportunities are then presented to the competition\'s winners and top performers.\n\n# What was your project about ?\n\nThe objective of this project was to program an FPGA based robot using Haskell - a Functional Programming Language, and Clash compiler which is capable of generating Verilog/VHDL/SystemVerilog code out of it. The\nobjective also included comparing different parameters namely efficiency, cost matrix between the Functional approach and the Conventional approach.\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nThe campus was incredibly welcoming and supportive of its students.\nThere was a lot of positive engagement and knowledge transfer among interns and students from various states in India. While working as an intern, one has the opportunity to learn about all other projects happening concurrently in the lab and campus, which broadens the perspective.\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nConfidential.\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nThe project is not currently open sourced. If ever it becomes open sourced that I will put up a link here.\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nDo actively take part in the eYRC competition that is held annually. Maintain an active presence on their forum and discussion channels. Concentrate on your learnings more; it will never be wasted.\n\n# What is the best way to contact you ?\n\nYou can contact me at my email, [siddesh1patil@gmail.com](mailto:siddesh1patil@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddesh-patil-497b50206)\n'}},function(e){e.O(0,[888,774,179],function(){return e(e.s=9038)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
