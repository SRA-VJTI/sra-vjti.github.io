They had already tapeout Moushik, RISECREEK, RIMO processors from SCL and intel foundries. These processors were based on the C and E classes of SHAKTI. Shakti is now going to tapeout the new I class. My project was based primarily on FPGA Based verification of SHAKTI processors. For selected Interns the duration usually depends on project complexity and current need of the Lab.

A former verification team member of shakti referred me to the verification team leader. After that, interviews happened. Shakti usually has open positions related to physical design, verification and software.\n\n# What was your project about ?\n\nC-Class is a member of the SHAKTI family of processors. It is an extremely configurable and commercial-grade 5-stage in-order core supporting the standard RV64GCSUN ISA extensions. Verification is a very important process in chip design. Usually, the software RTL simulation tests on host computers take a very large amount of time. My project explores the possibility of FPGA-based verification of SHAKTI processors to reduce verification time. AAPG is a tool that is intended to generate random RISC-V programs to test RISC-V cores. In this project, I ran AAPG tests on an FPGA and compared the spike's golden signature dump with the FPGA signature dump. The project also explores the self checking tests generated by AAPG. Self-checking tests have the advantage of running on FPGA or silicon without much intervention from the host, thereby accelerating the speed verification significantly.\n\nMore Info can be found here: [https://omkarbhilare.tech/pdf/SHAKTI_REPORT.pdf](https://omkarbhilare.tech/pdf/SHAKTI_REPORT.pdf)\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nIt was remote, but usually interns can directly come to SHAKTI Lab and work there itself.\nSHAKTI has good connections with industry and other VLSI research groups like OPENHW.

It has a real-time unit inside it called the PRU (Programmable Real-time unit). Since, real-time tasks like sending a pulse every 10 ms, is a difficult task for a chip running any OS which schedules task, there is a need for a co-processor which isn't bound by the scheduler and can do task in real time like a microcontroller can (to an extent). PRU is exactly this co-processor. But programming it is a difficult task, due to its low RAM and ROM size and also due to poor support from TI. So, making it easy for programming was of priority. There were earlier attempts to port interpreted languages onto it, but due to only 8Kb ram this was not feasible. I worked on creating a transpiled language called \\*\\*simpPRU. It had a syntax just like python. It was super easy to get started, and didn't need any extensive language of gcc, C and Linux kernel framework. So, earlier loading a firmware onto PRU meant, compiling the firmware, loading it into PRU using remoteproc framework and then starting it. This was a very steep learning curve for a beginner, So, simpPRU does all this for you, so it is as easy as running and compiling a program. Also, I created a TUI based terminal for reading and writing to the PRU using remoteproc.\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nIt was remote, N/A\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nIt was $3000 divided into 3 evaluations.\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nHere's my project report: [https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/6551712266977280/](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/6551712266977280/)\n\nHere's my project repository: [https://github.com/VedantParanjape/simpPRU](https://github.com/VedantParanjape/simpPRU)\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nStart early, join the organization's communication channel from January itself, and start contributing to their projects, take part in meetings and interact with the possible mentors.

The task was to develop an application for vehicle counting, detecting violations like wrong side, red light, speed, helmet and triple seat.\n\nWe started with listing out the requirements of the product, its users, use cases, deployment requirements and reviewed the technologies available in the market. There used to be meetings at least 2-3 days a week with the mentor. After listing the requirements the task was to get familiar with the object detection networks like yolo, ssd, etc. In the first two weeks I studied about the yolo network (running the pre-trained network and training it for custom classes like helmet). The next task was to track the object and count them. I studied different trackers available like OpenCV inbuilt trackers, SORT, Deep-SORT, etc. After analyzing the runtime, memory and other aspects we decided to use a particular tracker and started with the counting part. Several techniques were tried for the counting part to handle different edge cases. Till this point the team got familiar with the tech and the requirements. We divided the task among ourselves and started working on the application. At the end of 3 months, we were ready with the desktop application providing an interface to add recording, count vehicles based on classes, and detect all the violations.\n\nI had been approached by the organization to continue the work which we had left previously. I started working with them after the end semester exams were over.\n\nThe task given to me was to package our application and create a docker container for it.The advantage of docker container were that all your application and dependencies could be packaged as whole, such that the next time you want to deploy your application to the host computer, all you needed to do was to just install the docker container from the repository and execute it, nothing else was needed to install. I was also tasked with on how could we spawn multiple docker containers at a time, and also check if the minimum resources were available before starting a new container. My other task were to optimize the object detection model such as yolov3 and ssd-mobilenet with Nvidia's TensorRt sdk so that it could work with a higher fps on their edge boards,Jetson Nano and Jetson AGX. Wrote a small code which checked for system configuration, based on that used to install the docker container. Also used to sort out any issue which occurred on the AGX board.\n\n# How was the host in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nIt was remote, N/A\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nConfidential\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nConfidential\n\n# What is the best way to contact you ?\n\nYou can contact me at my email, rahulsinghrox701@gmail.com\n"},OXPT:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.r(t),t.default="# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?\n\nI was a research intern under Dr. Patrick Das Gupta from Delhi university. The main focus of my research was early time cosmology. The research was completely theoretical and the prerequisites included tensor calculus, differential equations and basic knowledge regarding general relativity. It was a two month long winter internship.\n\n# How do you approach the Organization/University ?\n\nIn general, there are summer internships available at such universities but I was late to apply so I started contacting several professors through their email id available at the university website. I got a positive response from Dr. Patrick Das Gupta but he was unavailable in the coming summer, hence it was a winter internship.\n\n# What was your project about ?\n\nInitially, there wasn't any particular problem statement on which I was working. Being from an engineering background there were a lot of prerequisites to be understood. Under the professor's guidance, I learned about general relativity followed by its application in the Friedmann\u2013Lema\xeetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker (FLRW) Models in cosmology. I then investigated the early universe cosmology and the various theories proposed regarding the same. I got to know about the horizon problem and the flatness problem and how inflationary cosmology solves it. While learning inflationary cosmology I also understood how cosmological fluctuation brings a structure to the universe by understanding Cosmological Perturbation Theory. During this brief period, I was able to develop my mathematical skills in tensor algebra, tensor calculus, differential calculus and also gained contemporary knowledge in the field of cosmology. After gaining the required knowledge I decided my primary research area to be 'The Cosmological Constant Problem'. I tried to implement 'Time Crystals' as a scalar field for inflationary cosmology which leads to an arbitrarily small positive effective Cosmological Constant.\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nAs it was not an official internship under the university, I had to stay outside the campus and only interacted with the professors twice a week.\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nN.A.\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nN.A.\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nThere are a lot of opportunities available to work as a research intern in physics.

So, I started emailing a lot of professors to ask for their guidance and if possible to work under them as a research intern. I tried to contact around 60-70 professors, half of which didn't reply and from the other half I got a negative response. After a month-long effort I received a positive response from Patrick sir.

But now it is stable through this project.\nIn this project, I was developing and testing the existing software support of Beaglewire. The known primary issue in Beaglewire was the interface between 32MB SDRAM and ICE40HX4K. For this Solution, I tried an FPGA-proven solution like LiteDRAM(a small footprint and configurable DRAM core). There were current Issues opened on BeagleWire Repository, These were solved during this project. More PMODs are interfaced with the BeagleWire now.\nIncreased the Documentation and also added a new programming method for FPGA with a proper starting guide for new users who want to experiment with BeagleWire.In this project I was going to test all the subsystems like I2C, SPI, PWM, UART in Hardware and the primary goal will be to debug the issues related to them and fix them accordingly.\n\n- You can read more about this project here: [**https://beaglewire.github.io/**](https://beaglewire.github.io/)\n- Final report video can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAvT4ZFW7Hg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAvT4ZFW7Hg)\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nGSoC is remote, N/A\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\n**$1500** in 2 evaluations of 45% (week 6) and 55%(week 10) payment\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\n- GSoC Report of BeagleWire **:** [**https://beaglewire.github.io/**](https://beaglewire.github.io/)\n- BeagleWire Software Repo **:** [**https://github.com/BeagleWire/BeagleWire**](https://github.com/BeagleWire/BeagleWire)\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nJoin the IRC/Discord as early as possible.

The task was to train a model which can detect, classify and localise Indian vehicles. Also the detected vehicles have to be tracked and counted. Further the Indian trucks had to be sub-classified according to the number of axles.\n\nFor this task our team was given a week to do literature review and get familiar with training and using YOLO, SSD models. Firstly a dataset of Indian vehicles was made and a YOLO model was trained. After training the task was to get inference and check the accuracy of the model. The next task was to track the vehicles to count them. Different trackers like KCF, CSRT, median flow etc were explored and later we used SORT tracker for tracking. For sub-classifying trucks a lightweight model was trained.\n\nThe second task was to detect speed violations in a video. A report had to be generated and statistics had to be shown. This was a requirement by a client so specific analytics had to be calculated which cannot be disclosed.\n\nWeekly meetings took place and during that time the mentor discussed the work done during the week and pointed us towards the right direction whenever we were struck.\n\nAfter this my internship was extended and I was working during the semester. The task was to create a product so that the client can detect specific violations in a rtsp stream/ a video file.

My project was to backport the scheduler feature from Linux 5.13 and Linux 5.12 to the LTS version. The backport required reviewing commits and understanding the major part of the scheduler. At the end of the project, the last 2 weeks were spent to run the test on the kernel, few reported bugs were solved and the Linux 5.10 LTS patch was released.\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nIt was remote.N/A\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\n$1400\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nHere is my project repository :- [https://gitlab.com/alfredchen/projectc](https://gitlab.com/alfredchen/projectc)\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nGet connected with the mentor as soon as the Selected Organizations are listed.

[Airpix.io](https://airpix.io/) is an analytics platform that provides services in face recognition, video analytics, optical character recognition by Leveraging AI, Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning technologies. [AIsyte](https://aisyte.com/) is the product that provides these analytics services.\n\nMy position in internship was 'AI ML and Edge Computing Intern'. The tasks were related to developing applications for Traffic monitoring, Face recognition, Pose estimation, etc. The position required knowledge in Python, Numpy, OpenCV, Deep Learning frameworks like Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, etc. It started with a 3 months unpaid internship. After that I was given the opportunity to continue the work with a paid internship. I worked under the guidance of Aniket Tatipamula.\n\n# How do you approach the Organization/University ?\n\nThe application form was sent by my college. But you can also reach out to them via email or linkedin.\n\n# What was your project about ?\n\nIn the first 3 months, we were divided into groups to tackle different problems. I was part of the group - Traffic violation. The task was to develop an application for vehicle counting, detecting violations like wrong side, red light, speed, helmet and triple seat.\n\nWe started with listing out the requirements of the product, its users, use cases, deployment requirements and reviewed the technologies available in the market. There used to be meetings at least 2-3 days a week with the mentor. After listing the requirements the task was to get familiar with the object detection networks like yolo, ssd, etc. In the first two weeks I studied about the yolo network (running the pre-trained network and training it for custom classes like helmet). The next task was to track the object and count them. I studied different trackers available like OpenCV inbuilt trackers, SORT, Deep-SORT, etc. After analyzing the runtime, memory and other aspects we decided to use a particular tracker and started with the counting part. Several techniques were tried for the counting part to handle different edge cases. Till this point the team got familiar with the tech and the requirements. We divided the task among ourselves and started working on the application. At the end of 3 months, we were ready with the desktop application providing an interface to add recording, count vehicles based on classes, and detect all the violations.\n\nI got an offer to continue the work after this.The work started after my mid-sem exams. The initial task was to develop an application for face recognition. The starter code was already written by the previous interns. The whole project can be summarized as follows: requirement specification \u2192 robust detector \u2192 network for recognition \u2192 storing info in database \u2192 testing on large database \u2192 visualizing the results on the video frame itself in real time \u2192 basic web platform.\n\nThe next project was to develop an application for license plate recognition (since this will be required after violation detection too). The starter code was available, which was written by the previous interns. The whole project can be summarized as follows: requirement specification \u2192 understanding interns' code \u2192 listing out shortcomings \u2192 reviewing available methods \u2192 trying different techniques \u2192 developing pipeline to take in the video and show the license plate text on the frames.\n\nThe next project was to combine the work of violation team and vehicle classification and develop a desktop application wherein the client can:\n\n- Add video recordings\n- Select the tasks to perform\n- Draw region of interests\n- Get visual output of all the violations / any event according to the tasks selected\n- Have the ability to do RUD operations on the output.\n\n\\*\\* All above projects were also made to run on edge platforms\n\nThe most important thing to take away from this is that every project should start with the requirement specification and system design. The mentor (Aniket Tatipamula) helped a lot whenever we had no clue of how to develop something at scale. He always urged us to develop the system flow, possible flaws, and their remedies. This helped a lot in understanding the problem and developing the solution for the same.\n\n# How was the host in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nIt was remote, N/A\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nConfidential\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nConfidential\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nEven if you don't have specialized knowledge in the topics, the internship gives you the opportunity to excel in those fields and develop industry ready products. The internship is the best way to understand the importance of ML in production and scaling of the same.\n\nThe company also provides job opportunities in areas of drone development and web designing.\n\n# What is the best way to contact you ?\n\nYou can contact me at my email, [saharshjain2000@gmail.com](mailto:saharshjain2000@gmail.com)\n"},vmKc:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.r(t),t.default="# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?\n\nGoogle Summer of Code is an international, annual program in which Google awards stipends to students who successfully complete a free and open-source software coding project during the summer. I was working with BeagleBoard for this period, it designs open source Single Board computers, like the BeagleBone Black, BeagleBone AI, BeagleV, etc. Application period for it was in March, and we had to submit a detailed proposal for the project Idea I wanted to work on. It was a 12 weeks long program.\n\n# How do you approach the Organization/University ?\n\nI joined their IRC and slack channel, and communicated with my mentors about my interest in the project. Then one has to sign up with the GSoC portal, and upload the project proposal for the specific project, which would then be reviewed by the organization.\n\n# What was your project about ?\n\nAs given on the official website, Bela is a hardware and software system for creating beautiful interaction with sensors and sound.\nBela has a lot of analog and digital inputs and outputs for hooking up sensors and controlling other devices, and most importantly Bela has stereo audio i/o allowing you to interact with the world of sound.\nAll Bela systems so far use the same Bela software. It uses a customized Debian distribution which - most notably - uses a Xenomai kernel instead of a stock kernel. Xenomai is co-kernel for Linux which allows to achieve hard real-time performance on Linux machines (ref: xenomai.org). It thus takes advantage of features of the BeagleBone computers and can achieve extremely low-latency audio and sensor processing times.\nAlthough the proposal Title mentions support for AI, I have developed a standardized setup that allows an easy jump across all TI chips.\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nIt was remote, N/A\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nIt was $1500 divided into 2 evaluations.\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nHere's my project report: [https://dhruvag2000.github.io/Blog-GSoC21/](https://dhruvag2000.github.io/Blog-GSoC21/)\n\nHere's my project repository: [https://github.com/giuliomoro/Bela-dhruva](https://github.com/giuliomoro/Bela-dhruva)\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nStart early, join the organization's communication channel from January itself, and start contributing to their projects, take part in meetings and interact with the possible mentors.
