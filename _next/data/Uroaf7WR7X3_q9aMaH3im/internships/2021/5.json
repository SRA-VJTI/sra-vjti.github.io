Later the major focus has been their installer script.\n\n# How do you approach the Organization/University ?\n\nI contacted the main person and asked for some possible cues for self improvement because I was not selected for WasmEdge LFX mentorship. But they offered me an internship externally.\n\n# What was your project about ?\n\nIt is mostly about a bash script of 650+ lines that used to work robustly. However their demands increased and we shifted to a python script of 1500+ Lines. The things we do for money.\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nThe organization is Second State Inc. An uplifting and chill environment.\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nUSD 1000 per month.\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nJoin their discord server or slack channel or view their GitHub.\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nBe thorough with C++, Linux, Bash Scripting, Python Scripting, and know how to Google.\n\n# What is the best way to contact you ?\n\nIf you are not on discord - shreyasatre16 AT gmail dot com\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
