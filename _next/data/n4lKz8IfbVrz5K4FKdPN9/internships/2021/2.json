Within a span of 2 months (lesser than that) it was not possible for me to come up with something that's better than current methods. I did learn a lot about GNNs, etc.\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nI did a remote internship because it was COVID-19.\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nNothing, interest basis.\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nCheck out the examples from SNAP and DGL.\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nDonâ€™t take suggestions on topics neither of you are familiar with. Also clarify whether they are going to provide you with an LOR before starting anything.\n\n# What is the best way to contact you ?\n\nIf you are not on discord - shreyasatre16 AT gmail dot com\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
