Neither was much research involved.\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\n$1500 USD, same for every Indian in GSoC '21\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nMy final [blog](https://kushkothari200-medium.com/gsoc-final-report-6fcade313d9f) is a good place to get started.\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nKeep a mentality of open source in mind, and the communication with your mentor is the most important for selection. Wise project selection is also a must.\n\n# What is the best way to contact you ?\n\nMy email address is [kushkothari2001@gmail.com](mailto:kushkothari2001@gmail.com) Feel free to mail me any time.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
