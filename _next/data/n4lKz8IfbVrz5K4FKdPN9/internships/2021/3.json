The duration was from September 2021 - November 2021.\n\n# How do you approach the Organization/University ?\n\nI applied via the official portal of The Linux Foundation.\n\n# What was your project about ?\n\nThe work involved creation of a novel algorithm with custom boundary extrapolation, specifically suited for wider vector architectures such as RISC-V. I also presented my work in the global mentorship summit organized by The Linux Foundation which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H08LzJamo0o).\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nIt was a remote internship. The environment was supportive and helpful.\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\n3000 USD (paid in two installments)\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/meshtag/c31498b4075e35598df66bfcc0c6b2ab\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nBe thorough with C++, basics of compiler backend, LLVM style lowering. Make sure to present your work properly (with source code and relevant proofs). Make sure to communicate effectively.\n\n# What is the best way to contact you ?\n\nIf you are not on discord - prathameshtagore@gmail.com\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
