My interview experience and introduction mail are uploaded on #interview-experience channel of SRA Discord server.\n\n# What was your project about ?\n\nThe work is not complete yet. As of now, I am spending time to become more familiar with their custom infrastructure for domain-extensible compilers.\n\n# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?\n\nGSoC is remote.\n\n# How much was your stipend ?\n\nConfidential.\n\n# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?\n\nNope, the project is still in its cradle.\n\n# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.\n\nBe thorough with C++, basics of compiler backend, LLVM style lowering. Prior research experience helps a lot. Make sure to present your work properly (with source code and relevant proofs). Make sure to communicate effectively.\n\n# What is the best way to contact you ?\n\nIf you are not on discord - prathameshtagore@gmail.com\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
